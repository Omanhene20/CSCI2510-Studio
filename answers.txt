The `cat` command echoes everything typed until CTRL+D is pressed.
Using `cat < mars.txt` displays the file content.
`cat < mars.txt > new.txt` copies `mars.txt` content into `new.txt`.
`cat > new.txt` allows user input and saves it to `new.txt`, overwriting  
existing content.
`cat >> new.txt` appends user input to `new.txt` instead of overwriting   
it.
`copy.c` reads input and writes it to output like `cat`.
